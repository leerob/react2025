# Conclusion

**Congrats, we made it!** âœ¨ Let's review this section.

- We added Firebase on the server-side, allowing us to utilize SSG methods on the server-side, as well as Next.js API routes to fetch data.
- We set up Chakra UI for styling on the front-end, added a custom font (Inter), and extended `_app.js` and `_document.js`.
- We learned about dynamic routing and created the feedback page.
- We configured our project to use absolute imports and aliases.
