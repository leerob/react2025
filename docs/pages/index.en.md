# Welcome to React 2025

This course will show the journey from zero lines of code to production for a real SaaS app called [Fast Feedback](/introduction/product-overview). We'll build the application with modern, open-source software.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) / [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase Authentication / Firestore](https://firebase.com/)
- Subscription payments with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- Deployed serverless to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

This course will teach you all the skills necessary to launch your own SaaS business. We'll use an opinionated set of tooling, allowing us to focus on shipping our product. Then, you can spend more time doing the things you love.

- ✅ &nbsp; Building your product
- ✅ &nbsp; Deploying with ease
- ✅ &nbsp; Making your customers happy
- ✅ &nbsp; Working with modern tools
- ✅ &nbsp; Transform front-end to full-stack.

We'll quickly iterate and deploy our code, bringing our ideas to life across the full-stack. Using Jamstack and the optimal workflow for front-end developers, we'll:

- Build dynamic applications that become static.
- Push code to a repository with Git.
- Deploy instantly to a global CDN.

This written guide is meant to complement the [product codebase](https://github.com/leerob/fastfeedback). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to `me@leerob.io` or [@leeerob](https://twitter.com/leeerob).
